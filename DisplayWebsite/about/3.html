# Regaining Motivation ~ Kazen

It was junior year, we had just made the idea the summer prior and had already given up. Or if anything we put it off, we had the comfort of only being Juniors.

> "We had more time", is what we thought...

However during that year the project never left my mind, not even once. I think I was in denial. I hadn't realized how much I wanted this project to happen.

## A Lack of Direction

There actually is a specific conversation where I regained the motivation. And even though the person involved doesn't know it, I dedicate a lot of the future success of this project to them. So I'd like to preface this by saying thank you. **Thank you** for listening to me and giving the honest reaction that I so desperately needed at the time.

If this conversation hadn't happened I'm very sure that the project would have stayed as just a failed project.


It was the spring of Junior year. I had just finished a pretty tough fall semester and had made my next semester incredibly light. That spring semester wasn't great for a lot of reasons, but the main being I had lost my spark. I've had plenty of semesters where I overworked myself way too hard but underworking myself felt new. Everyone needs differnt things but in retrospect, I can say for certain that a semester like that is not what I needed. For reference, I was taking 3 credits. I TA'ed for credit, took a class I probably only spent 10 hours on **total** (NEUR 1065: Biology of Hearing), and lastly took a CLPS/CS Seminar (CLPS 1950), it felt like I was only taking 1 class.

I went to the ratty to get dinner with an old friend of mine (new at the time). While I was kind of in a slump at the time. This person was different. They definitely had their own issues and things they were going through, but to me I could see that spark. That glint in their eyes. They were involved in cool things and were creating cool things.

The crazy thing about being in a slump is you forget all the cool things you've done. It didn't matter that I'd launched a sattelite, or made countless quirky websites and projects. Because all that mattered was at that moment I was directionless.

During that dinner, I mentioned the project to them off a whim, but I probably wanted to prove to myself that I still had it... that I wasn't a shell of my old self.

As I talked about the idea I could see their eyes light up not only by how cool the project was but also by how passionate I was about it. 

However, what followed this was me explaining a lot of the reasons why it couldn’t be done. I remember them saying “Why not?” With a saddened tone. As I continued to give reasons why it couldn’t be done and their face continued to soften **it hit me**. 

I realized then that I was just making excuses. **Yes**, the project would be hard, but I hadn’t even really started it. That one response saved me. I was so focused on all the reasons why I **couldn’t**, instead of why I **could**.

It didn't matter if I was in a slump, or how people perceived me. I had a thing I wanted to do and the only one stopping me from doing it was myself. Simply put, **why not?**

## A Little Crazy

This mindset stuck with me through many of the tough times on the project. The project was definitely not easy. Hundreds of hours were spent, way more than can even be showcased in our tech documents

I think it takes a certain amount of crazy to do such a project. I wouldn’t say I'm especially good at CS or engineering, but it's just I'm crazy enough to not know my limits, and ignore the commonsense that might have told someone that this project was too much. 

When I think about the people I knew at Brown that did cool things. Whether it be making a club, a personal project, or a startup, I'd say that they all had one trait in common.

They were all a little crazy.

And that's a good thing, having something you can go crazy for is beautiful.

## Moving Forward

To be clear I didn't just start grinding this project the day after, but that was the start of me knowing this project **had** to be done. I knew that I would regret it forever if I didn't. The me that I wanted to become was now permanently intertwined with this project. *If I could make this silly little dream come true what else could I do?*

Junior year quickly came to a close. But, out of my reasons for not doing the project, I was right about one thing. I still had a lot to learn before this project could be pulled off. It was time to start [gaining skills](4.html).
