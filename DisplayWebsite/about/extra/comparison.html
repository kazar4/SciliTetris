# Original Email

> Hello,
> 
> My name is Kazen Gallman. I’m a senior studying Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience.
> 
> I’m sending this email to ask about the feasibility of a Scili Tetris project like the one made 24 years ago by [tech house](http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org). It has been a dream of mine to make this project ever since getting into Brown. The novelty of the project this time around would be more games, color options, all packed in a modern and easily reproducible system.
> 
> 2 years ago we sent a proposal to Dean Zia to ask about this and were told you would be the best person to email. However we felt that at the time we did not have the experience or skills necessary to make it happen. Since then we have worked really hard to grow our skills. In addition we have already done the majority of the ground work.
> 
> We do understand how late it is to do this as it would have to be done before we graduate on May 27th, and I completely understand if it is not possible. However we are extremely confident that given approval we can finish it in less than a month.
> 
> Here is a [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MzE6N-JT5UCzsw5Hnx3ACSEer4fL3DmJ/view) to a project specification document that explains the project in more depth so I definitely recommend reading it. I’d love if we could have a meeting to discuss this more.

# Edited Email

> Hello,
> 
> As a senior studying Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience I care a lot about the way technology can be used with art and gaming to influence a large population. The Sciences Library has been historically used to communicate these messages not only inside itself, but also with its own walls and windows.
> 
> We propose to resurrect the [Sciences Library Tetris Project](http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org) that was first implemented 24 years ago by Tech House. In its new form the project will have more **color options**, more **games**, and be packed in a **modern** and **easily reproducible** system.
> 
> This project would celebrate not only the original’s **24th anniversary** but also the class of **24’s graduation**. We want to celebrate the hard work and perseverance of this class. With both of these celebrations in mind, it is the perfect time to bring back such a project. Between games the text '24 would be displayed combined with colorful graphics.
> 
> Two years ago, Dean Zia recommended we contact you as the next step in our proposal. We’ve waited until now so that our project is more fully formed. We have now proven the feasibility of the project at small scale physically and at large scale with simulations. We would love to share that with you.
> 
> While there is much to do before we graduate, given approval we will be able to proceed and complete it by May 15th.
> 
> This project was one of the main things that made me go to Brown. The excitement and passion as technology, art, and gaming merges is something we want to share to the world and greater Brown community. As the class of 24 leaves the gates we hope to help empower us all to continue to do great things, and I believe this project can be a facilitator of that.
> 
> Linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MzE6N-JT5UCzsw5Hnx3ACSEer4fL3DmJ/view) is a project specification document which gives more information on our goals and progress.
> 
> Please let me know if this meets with approval, or if you would like to meet to discuss it in more detail.
