# Some Funny Stories ~ Kazen

##**#free josh**

One of our members, Josh Liu was probably the start of the Gulag jokes. He was the first friend that joined and we didn't expect the amount of soldering that still had to be done. After our first day soldering for 8 hours with him we started to joke that it was like a production line.

Josh had very recently got into a relationship too, and we were friends with her leading to a lot of banter. I remember one night in particular we had been working for a couple of hours. Josh had plans with her that night but wanted to finish a bit more of the soldering since he was on a roll. Not long after I received this text

This continued maybe 1 or 2 more times. And thankfully this project didn't cause any issues with their relationship.

##**me continuing to order too few parts 5 times / we love whole foods**

Ordering parts was an ongoing process. I have a lot of respect for Product Managers and people who handle inventory at companies now.

I didn't know it was possible to order the wrong amount of parts 5 times but somehow thats what happened. 

In the beginning we had to reorder because we wanted each LED strip to longer, and other times it was because I read 100 as 50 or 50 as 25 when looking at part counts. Near the end some essential parts even got lost in shipping. 

The turn around time was so fast that we couldn't even ship to Brown's mail room anymore. This was because the mail room takes longer to ship to from amazon then other addresses. 

Many parts we'd order on amazon and ship to the amazon lockers at Whole Foods. In the span of 2 weeks we probably went to whole foods 8 times. Soely so we could get the 1 day shipping that they offered. 

The night before setup we were receiving essential parts from Whole Foods. We became so desperate we'd order multiple of the same part incase one of them delayed. 


##**trees????** 

This goes back a bit before the gulag. It was the day we had our first meeting with the Scili Staff and pretty much the day that we actually got approval. 

They walked us into the secret staff area of the Scili, where we found Paul Bassett's office. During this meeting the staff was both skeptical and excited. We then went to every floor taking notes on the quirks of each floor. Which ones would be good for testing, which ones would need special access, and which ones would require extension coords for power.

David and I left the building in awe. *This was actually happening*...

We walked over to steps in front of MacMillan Hall to look at the SciLi from afar. We talked over some technical details before I froze for a second.

> Hey, David... are those trees going to be a problem

> Uhhhhhh, yep

It now made complete sense why the original project was showcased during mid to late april. Any later and the leaves would grow and obscure the view. 

There wasn't much we could do here. There were many jokes made about getting rid of the trees potentially with fire. But for obvious reasons we were not going to commit arson. 

Thew view still turned out great and we do think showing it during covocation had its own charm that late-april wouldn't of had. But this is defintely something to consider later. And for us in particular it was not even an option due to how behind we were on construction.



##**Keeping the Project Secret - Injuring My Best Friend**

Since the project was being kept secret we did not have our first outside play tester until the night before launch. 

I had already envisoned who I wanted to test it first. She was one of my closest friends that i'd known since we were pre-frosh. She was also an avid Tetris player. 

The night before launch I convinced her to go on a walk with me, she thought I was depressed since it was quite late. She knew I had been keeping a project of mine secret but didn't think that this was related. 

As I brought her to the SciLi I realized that I left the lights on from my test 15 minutes earlier. Flustered I had her quickly close her eyes and told her this was actually to show her the project. I guided her to Macmillion to get a good good viewing angle. But I forgot that there were steps leading to the door.

You can probably imagine what happens when you walk into concrete stairs with your eyes closed thinking its flat. And I was the one who guided/pushed her...

She fell and scrapped the ground getting a medium sized cut on her hand. Words cannot describe how bad I felt. Not sure how I could fumble a surprise that hard.

After we looked for a bandage I showed her the project. It was a great reaction. But the process leading up to it was defintely scuffed. Just like the project itself it was scuffed and not always to plan.

After that I called David over now and we continued the testing. It was crazy that the project was going to be shown in a day. We all sat together on the tables in front of the SciLi eating Bahas.
