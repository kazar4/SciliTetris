# April's Testimony 

Working late into the night stripping wires and cutting LED strips in a cramped little room with four of my friends was definitely not how I envisioned my final week before graduating from Brown. However, I wouldn't change a thing. 

I was recruited for this project just days before the installation, and it was a monumental task. All the lights had to be cut, prepared, and tested, with everyone playing a crucial role in the production line. My tasks included stripping wires, measuring and cutting LED strips, and wrapping electrical tape around the soldered parts to ensure safety. Despite my cramping hands and torn skin from the manual labor, my heart was full of joy when we finished all 110 LED Strips and were ready to put them up.

On installation day, I woke up bright and early and headed to the Scili, which felt strange after finals had ended. On my quiet walk there, I thought about how it was the earliest I had ever been to the library and probably my last time in the stacks. It was bittersweet. The next 5-6 hours were a blur of dashing up and down every level—some of which were completely new to me—installing lights and components in each window. Some floors were locked, others were open. Some lights worked perfectly, others stubbornly refused to cooperate. However, we never gave up. Watching the campus being gradually illuminated by the rising sun level by level from the Scili as we worked that day is a memory I will never forget.

The days leading up to the light show installation debut were full of anticipation. With my amateur graphic design skills, I quickly whipped up a poster to spread the news about our creation on social media to our peers. I was nervous—not only because friends and strangers would see our work for the first time, but also because the night of the debut would be my first time seeing the final creation. As we all huddled together outside the Scili that night, I was overjoyed when all of the windows came to life with light. It worked! It was truly an unforgettable sight! We spent hours playing Tetris, Snake, and drawing rainbows and smiley faces on the windows. 

Seeing our hard work pay off, and having our friends we made over the years to enjoy it was the most rewarding part. I will never forget this incredible experience.
