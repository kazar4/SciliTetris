# We did a thing ~ Kazen

The SciLi became a pretty special place to me during this time. I hadn't really studied there since sophomore year, but it symbolized something more to me. 

When the project was just in its infancy or even when it was just an idea, I'd walk by the SciLi a lot, and sometimes stop and think to myself:

> "Someday I'm going to be back here, lighting up that building"

I'd envision this completed project and showing it to the Brown community. I'd imagine LED lights filling the windows playing Tetris or Snake or whatever game we could think of. This happened less as the project got closer to completion, partly because we were too busy to even think about the future, but also maybe because unlike before it wasn't just a dream anymore, it was a reality.

## The Anticipation

It was the week we were set to launch and also Senior Week. Monday morning we had been setting up in the Scili for 5+ hours. This involved going to every floor of the SciLi and taping LEDs to the walls, uploading our firmware to our LED \`modules\`, lowering curtains, and testing them. After those exhausting hours, we went to the new Raising Canes recently built in RI.

We were relieved but also still very worried. We still had to fix a lot of the game's code and many of the LED \`modules\` were having trouble connecting to the WIFI. It was pretty scary. We could control a lot of the tech but the WIFI was something out of our jurisdiction. We had to work with IT on this many times.

We had 4 days until the day we planned to showcase. Every day was filled with making code updates during the morning and night while going to Senior Week events during the day. 

On Wednesday we had maybe 70% of the LED \`modules\` connecting to the WIFI, meaning there were a lot of black spots:

Our work with IT honestly deserves its own [blog post](https://), but there were a lot of server and wifi changes that had to be made at the last minute.

The morning of the project we were using garbage bags to make fake curtains for the SciLi floors that did not have them. While they did that I went to every floor on the SciLi and reuploaded code. If this code didn't fix our issues it was over.

This time things went more smoothly as I updated the \`modules\` they started to connect 1 by 1, and before I knew it they all were connected. 

When I showed that to David the relief on his face was apparent. For the first time this entire project we had confidence that **this was going to work**, just a few hours before showcase time.

## The First Night

This night was a fever dream since we were mainly worried about making sure it all worked. I'm sure other people had different experiences. But seeing it all together was surreal.

Admittedly one area we lacked was publicity. Our attempt to keep the project a secret until everything was working ended up hurting us as most of the Senior Class did not know it was happening (we had the Class Coordinating Board send an Instagram post a few hours before launch). Despite that, we still had a great turnout for the first day. Many students and friends of ours came. Even kids from the local high school robotics team I coach came to watch (I can't lie when they appeared out of nowhere it warmed my heart). 

## The Next Few Nights

The following night had a smaller crowd but probably a bigger impact. It was the day of the campus dance (10000+ people) so even if people weren't playing Tetris it was hard to ignore the giant building glowing as they funneled into the greens. We mainly had the Scili do animations that day. I'm sure many alumni and families thought it was just a part of the event run by the university. 

The last night was ironically the night before we graduated. By now a lot more people had heard the news and more parents and alumni were present. We had a scary moment at the beginning where things weren't connecting which was ironic for the last night compared to the others which ran perfectly but we got it sorted out.

To be honest it's hard to describe what this day was like. We had a lot of funny moments like a classmate drawing Amoung Us on the SciLi, and we had just actually added support for the game \`Pong\` that night.

Eventually, the numbers dwindled and it was just us and some close friends. I distinctly remember a friend telling me how it's crazy this is the last event we are going to before graduating. It was probably 11:30 PM, and we'd all have to wake up early to walk through the gates. But we were all happy that this was the last thing we were doing. Hanging out with friends in front of the Scili making jokes, celebrating cool tech, and playing the Tetris soundtrack on a speaker. It felt like one last hurray, just a couple of college students, goofing around.

It made me think about the community we all made at Brown. To think 4 years ago we all came to this campus quarantined because of Covid not knowing anything about what our time here would be like. 

## So, we did a thing

Once again this project was just a whim, but it was a whim that we were able to turn into a reality. And this isn't unique to us. Especially in the class of '24, I've watched countless whims become something more. New clubs, new projects, new events. You don't always hear about them or get the details on how they came to be, but just like this project, I know there's an interesting story there.

If anything this project is a love letter to the class that helped me grow into the person I am now. So I'm glad I got to show it.

And if you missed the project, maybe you'll even see us doing it again next year :)
