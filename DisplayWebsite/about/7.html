# The Gulag ~ David

We looked at the pile of wires before us, then at each other, then at the pile again.

I took off my glasses with one hand and started rubbing my eyes with the other. 

"Listen, Kazen, I am fully prepared and willing to pull all-nighters this weekend to get this done if we have to, but there's gotta be a better way of doing this."

We were sitting around hundreds of feet of LEDs, wires, and dozens of microcontroller chips, all waiting to be assembled by hand. The room we were in was a tiny workspace with no natural light except for a small semicircle-shaped window near the bottom of one of the walls. It smelled like metal and sawdust mixed with a little bit of glue. I was getting sick of the humming florescent lights overhead. 

Assembling the lighting modules by hand was something Kazen and I were putting off for as long as possible. The physical design itself was relatively simple, just strip some wires, crimp them, and attach two LEDs to each microcontroller unit. It's not a complicated procedure, just one that would take dozens of hours to fully complete. Given that we didn't have an offshore factory and God only gave us two hands, doing this with just the two of us would take tens of hours. Not to mention the fact that we were *technically* supposed to have most of these done already by last week.

"Ok, let's think. Who do we know that's crazy or stupid enough to spend what's most likely their last week of college in a cramped workshop to do manual labor?"

Surprisingly, we were able to come up with some names (I don't really know what this says about the type of people we are...), but the confidentiality of this whole project came into question. Originally, we wanted this to be a surprise for the entire class of 2024 with little to no notice before the big reveal. However, it has become increasingly clear that there was absolutely no way we could get this done in time by ourselves. We ended up recruiting three of our other friends to help with the assembly. 

What followed was an entire week's worth of that feeling you get when you're trying to finish your math homework on the bus right before school starts. I will be forever grateful to Josh, April, and Avi for getting us through the project with their support, especially since the whole process was manic from start to finish. Kazen and I quickly onboarded them to the manufacturing assembly line during the first few days: Josh soldered the microcontrollers onto the the circuit boards, Avi stripped wires, Kazen soldered LEDs onto those wires, I crimped those wires and connected them to the modules, and April did quality assurance testing and packaged the finished products into coils. There was pressure and stress, but there was also music, snacks, jokes, and laughter. I genuinely don't know whether this project would've finished at all if they didn't come along. 

We managed to finish enough units after a few days to do our first large-scale testing at night. It was around 12am and the entire campus was asleep. Kazen and I had set up our lighting modules on the 3rd and 4th floors, and we wanted to see how the lights would look when lighting up the whole row of windows. The weather wasn't great since it had been raining and there was a slight veil of mist in the air, making the lights from the buildings and street lamps bleed into each other. We booted up the admin console and turned on all the modules, and the windows were suddenly flooded with bright colors. None of us could look away.

And to think, all this cost was a little bit of our sanity!
