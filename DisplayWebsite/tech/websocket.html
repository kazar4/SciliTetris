# Backend Websocket Server

This was the first part of the project that was created, I had a lot of fun brainstorming the infrastructure of this with David. We even had our \`write on a napkin\` moment that you see in the beginnings of a lot of cool projects.

## Why WebSockets?

This is a pretty good question. If you aren't familiar with WebSockets it is a protocol on top of HTTP (which all websites use), that allows simultaneous two-way connection. 

A regular HTTP request is like it sounds: **a request**. It requests data from a server based on the link, gives them a bunch of metadata about who is receiving the data and why (\`headers\`), and then it receives the data and ends.

If we want more data we need to make another request, attach the headers, talk to the server, and agree to receive the data. If we want our data to be secure we also have to do something called a [handshake](https://howhttps.works/the-handshake/).

These actions are all fast, but over time they can lead to a delay. For a project like this, we want to continually send color data to our modules, and send game information. 

WebSockets are the natural solution here. They only have to do one handshake and after that, you can continue to send info. They remember each other so all that setup isn't needed if you want to send more data.

So let's make a WebSocket server:
> I used [this](https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server) WebSocket server library for the project, but for the future I'd recommend this [one](https://github.com/python-websockets/websockets), its been maintained longer, and the first library is missing some essential features.
\`\`\`python
from websocket_server import WebsocketServer

# Called for every client connecting (after handshake)
def new_client(client, server):
    print(f'New client connected and was given id {client["id"]}')

# Called when a client disconnects
def client_left(client, server):
    print(f'Client({client["id"]}) disconnected')

# Called when a client sends a message
def message_received(client, server, message):
    print(f'Received {message} from {client["id"]}')
    
    # server.send_message(client, message)

PORT=9001
server = WebsocketServer(host='localhost', port=PORT)

commands.start_ping_thread(server)

server.set_fn_new_client(new_client)
server.set_fn_client_left(client_left)
server.set_fn_message_received(message_received)
server.run_forever()
\`\`\`

In WebSocket land we have a bunch of \`clients\` which connect to our WebSocket \`server\`. If we want two clients, \`client_1\` and \`client_2\` to talk to each other. Then the server can act as a middleman, using \`server.send_message(client, message)\`. Think about how we could use \`message_received()\` and \`server.send_message()\` to transfer these messages between clients.
> Note: message_received() is called when any client sends a message to the server

Now onto our infrastructure. We planned to have 55 tiny modules or ESPs across the Scili acting as pixels. They need to be able to connect to this server, and quickly receive a color every time our games update.

Speaking of games let's say in our game the top left pixel turns red \`(0,0)\`. Naturally, we'd want to turn the top left pixel of the Scili red too. But, 
*How do we know what module is in that Scili window?* 

The issue is we don't, all the server sees is this:

// IMAGE of a bunch of ESP connected.

Sure we could hardcode them, but we hadn't even made a module yet, and it would also be a pain to reset the the hardcoding if we switched out a module. 

The crux of this backend relies on our solution here. At first, we thought it was overkill or overengineered. But many times throughout this project it made our lives a lot easier. 

We decided we'd create an ESP Module <-> Coordinate mapping on the fly.

Let's say we have an ESP on the SciLi connected with \`ID 5\`. 
We can have the server send \`setColor 5 #FF0000\` to turn that ESP Module red. Then we can look at the SciLi and see what pixel turned red. If the top left pixel turned red then we know \`ID 5 <-> (0,0)\` in our mapping.

By caching these values with the ESP's MAC address in a database, once we set all 55 modules we are essentially done. If we need to replace a module all we do is update its position with \`setCoord ESP# X Y\` which will also update the cache.

// Diagram

This makes our game logic a lot easier. As long as we make games with the same dimensions of pixels as the # of pixels we have, the games just need to send all of their colors. Similar to how a GPU tells your monitor what pixels to color, we'd be doing that with our server. The Scili would just be a large-scale monitor or LED display.

// One of our first tests with the software can be shown here

The natural progression of this is to make a UI, writing \`setColor\` and \`setCoord\` manually a bunch of times would be a pain, which led to our [admin display](https://)

## The Ping and Pong :(

Websockets are commonly taught as the solution for easy real-time-based systems. Hook them up and you have a two-way connection like FaceTime, data can be transferred between the two and if one disconnects you'll know that they did. 

Websockets, unfortunately, don't have the feature. In reality, they are a small abstraction upon HTTP. They don't know when their partner disconnects, or when the server closes. These all have to be told to each other before it happen (i.e. sending a message saying that you are going to close the connection).

What this means is that if the wifi cuts off suddenly and one of the modules is unreachable we don't actually know that. The server will keep trying to send messages into the void.

The way we solve this is with a \`Ping\` and \`Pong\`, it's a common networking practice to measure ping or latency. You send \`Ping\` to a device and upon receiving \`Ping\` they send \`Pong\` back. Once you receive that \`Pong\` you record how long it took, usually in milliseconds (\`ms\`). 

This is embedded in a lot of real-time processing tech, I thought it was a part of the WebSocket protocol by default. So you should keep this in mind if you're using WebSockets and want to handle the unintentional disconnect case.

The implementation isn't bad, but it took days to figure out why our modules or simulations would disconnect and our server wouldn't know. 

It even led to one of our biggest but funniest bugs.

---

> At the time we would call ping every 5 seconds. But we had a weird issue. All our LED modules would eventually freeze, they'd disconnect from our server, and not restart. Even though these LED modules were coded to restart if they ever froze.
> 
> This was pretty scary because with C (the language the LED/ESP modules used) there can be a billion reasons why something can freeze, and we had no idea how to fix the issues on our LED modules.
> 
> What we eventually found out is they weren't freezing at all...
> 
> Sometimes they'd lag for about 6 seconds. Just like long enough for our server to think that they were disconnected. This would make us remove them from our list of connected devices. But in reality, they were **still** connected to the server internally. 
> 
> We were helped by BDW Monitor Joshua Phelps who was essential in seeing this bug
> 
> I still remember we sat there, wondering what could possibly cause the modules to freeze when we had the epiphany *what if the modules never actually froze*
> 
> This was definitely a lesson in testing and slower development. Virtually all of this code was rushly written during Spring Break leading to this case not being properly handled
> 
> We increased the ping timer to 20seconds and also had the ESPs reset if they hadn't received a \`ping\` from the server in a set amount of time


## Kansas City

Latency was a big problem for us during the project. The ESP's generally had about 400ms of latency which was way to much for the game to be playable.

High latency would also make our bad synchronization more noticeable.

We worked with IT a lot on this, we hoped that if they made a new access point, the connection would be better (this was not the case).

During our talks, they asked us, 
> "Do you know where your server is located? 400ms is a lot of delay..."

I'm not sure why I didn't think this was the issue, but one terminal query later:

\`\`\`yaml
root@localhost:~# curl ipinfo.io
{
  "ip": "74.208.94.104",
  "city": "Kansas City",
  "region": "Missouri",
  "country": "US",
  "loc": "39.0997,-94.5786",
  "org": "AS8560 IONOS SE",
  "postal": "64106",
  "timezone": "America/Chicago",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
}
\`\`\`

### **Oh...**

Well turns out having your server in Missouri isn't the best for Rhode Island latency. Whoops.

We ended up getting a new server in New York that had about 200ms of latency, a huge improvement. On the last 2 days of showcasing the project, IT made us a server on campus that had about 150ms of latency. This is recommended because they can troubleshoot its speed to make it better since it is in-house. The only issue if you may have to deal with a VPN for devices accessing the server outside of Brown's network.

## Caching

We used a Sqlite3 Server to cache the MAC addresses of our ESP modules. The Primary key here is the MAC address. This would mean if we had to restart the server, when the modules reconnect they'd automatically assign their coordinate by looking inside the database. 

An example is shown below:

| mac | x | y |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 48:55:19:F0:34:22     | 6     | 1     |
| 40:91:51:59:02:17     | 2     | 1     |
| 40:91:51:58:78:5B     | 4     | 2     |
|... |... |...|

## The Next Steps

We designed this server to be quite powerful and extensive. I definitely worked harder on it than a lot of my CS class projects. However it's incomplete by itself, paired with a nice GUI it can give us a lot of control over the setup of our devices, you can read about that [here](https://)
