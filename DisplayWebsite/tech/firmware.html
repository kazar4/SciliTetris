# Microcontroller Firmware

Now with our microcontroller all set we need to create its firmware.

This firmware needs to be able to connect to a WebSocket Server, control our LEDs, and have redundancy.

The relevant code can be found [here](https://github.com/kazar4/SciliTetris/tree/main/ESPFirmware)

## General Architecture

We used the Arduino IDE to program our microcontroller. Our \`setup\` function does a few things. It enables the watchdog for 2 seconds.
> The watchdog or WDT is a common microcontroller system that checks if the program hangs and restarts the program if so. In this case, if our program freezes for >2sec the program will restart

Next we set up our LEDs with the [FastLED](https://fastled.io) library, connect to WIFI using the [ESP8266WiFi](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/readme.html) Library, and lastly connect to our WebSocket server with the [ESP8266-Websocket](https://github.com/morrissinger/ESP8266-Websocket) Library.

We record the time when the last Ping was received from the server. This allows us to check how long it has been since our last contact. If it's too long we can have the chip restart in case something is wrong with our wifi connection.

\`\`\`Arduino
void setup() {
  ESP.wdtEnable(WDTO_2S);
  
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial);
  delay(10);

  setUPLEDs();

  connectWifi();
  
  connectWebSocket();

  lastPing = millis();
}
\`\`\`

## Wifi & Websocket Connection

If you've read some of our posts in the [About](../about.html) section of the website you may have heard that this was one of the biggest blockers of the project before we officially started. This was mainly because of \`SSL\` issues. If you aren't familiar with \`SSL\` it is what keeps the web safe with encryption. Secure websites have the little padlock next to their link and become \`https://\` instead of \`http://\` (the \`s\` stands for secure).

Wifi connection is fairly standard with the \`ESP8266WiFi\` library, the issue was using that WIFI to then connect to a Secure WebSocket server. It took us a while to get to this code.


\`\`\`Arduino
void connectWebSocket() {
  // SSL fingerprint for bottom level cert kazar4.com
  const char *sslFingerprint = "DB 50 1E 9C 09 6D E5 E3 FF 91 D6 B2 CD B9 BE 9F FA F5 EA 29";

  client.setFingerprint(sslFingerprint);

  bool connectplz = client.connect("kazar4.com", 9001);

  if (connectplz) {
    Serial.println("Connected");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Websocket Connection failed. Resetting ESP");
    ESP.reset(); // Restart ESP on failure
  }

  // Handshake with the server
  webSocketClient.path = path;
  webSocketClient.host = host;
  if (webSocketClient.handshake(client)) {
    Serial.println("Handshake successful");

    // Send MAC Address to our server
    String macAddress = WiFi.macAddress();
    macAddress = "M-" + macAddress;
    webSocketClient.sendData(macAddress);
    
  } else {
    Serial.println("Handshake failed. Resetting ESP");
    ESP.reset();
  }
}
\`\`\`

The code doesn't look too bad even though most languages like JS and Python can do these steps in 1 line. We first run \`client.connect()\`, then initiate the WebSocket [handshake](https://www.nilebits.com/blog/2023/07/websocket-handshaking-explained-understanding-the-key-to-real-time-communication/) with \`webSocketClient.handshake(client)\`, and finally we send our MAC address to the server which is used in our code for cache purposes. 

So overall not too bad *right?* However what you might have noticed is the third line...

What the heck is a \`sslFingerprint\`?

I'll be honest I'm not an SSL wizard, I wish I was. I still don't understand why this library needs it when in JS you can connect to a WebSocket with just the link, or in Python where the cert info is optional. 

I was stuck on this part for a pretty long time and ran into a lot of weird issues in the process. It would also fail with [ngrok](https://www.sitepoint.com/use-ngrok-test-local-site/) which meant that during testing I had to run it on my server instead of locally if I wanted to connect the ESPs.

Pretty deep into my search, I came across [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59005181/unable-to-connect-https-protocol-with-esp8266-using-wificlientsecure). Which showed me how I could get an SSL fingerprint and apply it to my code. Words can't describe how excited I was when it first worked. 

> Note: when you go to get your sslFingerprint you'll notice several certificates under each other. Only one of them will work, it should be the level cert, but you may have to try multiple.

To be fair there are some issues with sslFingerprints, you can read about them [here](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2021/10/HTTPS-Requests-with-a-Root-Certificate-Store-on-ESP8266-Arduino.html) along with their complicated but better alternatives. They are essentially a hash of your SSL certificate, so they have to be replaced after your cert expires.

## The Curse of Synchronization 

Delay <-> Synchronization, these were two properties we worked effortlessly to optimize, however, we eventually came to realize that they are inversely related. 

In order to synchronize multiple modules together so they change colors at the same time, you'll have to delay some of them.\` If one module gets its color in 100ms, and all the others get it in 150ms, then you'll need to make that first module wait 50ms\`.

This was a common issue we had with ESPs. Wifi is fast but cannot always make guarantees on speed. Sometimes the modules would receive new packets fast, and other times slowly. There was no way to predict it.

On the flip side if you optimize only for a low delay then the modules could be unsynchronized.

There were several methods we tried to counteract this. One failed idea was to synchronize by time. The idea was
\`\`\`yaml
Lets say Module A has a ping/delay of 100ms, and Module B has a ping/delay
Lets assume that both modules know the exact time, 
and our server sends out a new color to both modules every 300ms.

[0ms] -> Server Sends Color
[100ms] -> Module A receives color
[200ms] -> Module B receives color

[300ms] -> Server Sends New Color
[400ms] -> Module A receives color
[500ms] -> Module B receives color

etc...

Based on this Module A will change colors 100ms faster than Module B. 
But what if we made Module A wait? And wait for how long??

Since both modules know the time, what if we had Module A wait 200ms 
and module B waits 100ms. Since they know new colors 
will be sent at 0ms, 300ms, 600ms, etc. 

The idea here is the modules are giving each other a buffer,
as long as a color is sent within that buffer, it will
be displayed in the next 300ms long frame. 

So we are giving every module a maximum delay of 300ms in exchange for synchronization. For our code, we choose around 200ms.
\`\`\`

But unfortunately, this doesn't work, because it turns out the assumption that all the modules know the time is incorrect. It's a **lot** harder to get electronics to know the time than you'd imagine. 

We could put a digital clock on each module but then we'd have to replace batteries constantly for 55 modules so that was a no. 

We thought we could get the time from WIFI. But the issue is we don't know the delay. \`If it takes 300ms for us to receive the time from online, then the time we receive will be 300ms from the past\`, and since we don't know whether or not it took 300ms or 100ms or 200ms for the sever to send the time back, we can't ever accurately get the true time.

This isn't just a problem with our tech too, your phones are probably 100-200ms off from other phones. This is especially prevalent on older phones. 

*What is Time?*

Well, it turns out it's just an arbitrary reading from the [NTP servers](https://www.ntppool.org/en/). I would have thought the internet was built off of an accurate system. Before this project, I even thought that there was a *true time*. But instead, it's just a messy reading that we've abstracted to work. 

Turns out time... really is relative, and I think that's pretty cool.

---

We still ended up using the algorithm above, it seemed to help a little bit, but as you will see in the videos of the project, synchronization was still an issue. 

The cool part of this kind of project. The one where you get to try things without being fed the right answer by a teacher is that you naturally start to find the optimal solutions and get a greater appreciation for why they exist. 

Most synchronizations at a large scale that need to be fast either use preplanned instructions or talk to each other. Given more time this is actually what we wanted to try. Instead of each module only connecting to the internet they could also connect to each other. Going back to modules A & B.
\`\`\`yaml
Module A and Module B are linked together,

The server knows this and sends the commands for both A & B
together. 

Module A receives its command at 100ms, and since it has
Module B's command is baked in, it tells B its command. 

Even though B doesn't receive its command naturally till 200ms,
it's fine because it already got it earlier from Module A
\`\`\`

WIFI will always have delay issues, so there could still be
issues, but generally by having the modules talk not only to the server but to **each other**, one could achieve the same synchronization that you see with industry systems and software.


## LED Coloring

There is a lot of boilerplate from FastLED, so not much needs to be mentioned here. But since we connected two wired LED strips we needed a way to talk to each separately.

We set the ESP to react to a \`$\` command.
If sent \`$1#FF0000\` from our server this would mean to set Strip 1 (\`$1\`) to Red using HexColors (\`#FF0000\`). \`$2\` would be for strip 2, and \`$3\` would mean for both strips.

If you've done a lot of C++ the parsing code below is probably familiar but it felt like black magic to me at the time:
\`\`\`C++
sscanf(buffer, "$%1c#%02hhx%02hhx%02hhx", &ledStrip, &tempR, &tempG, &tempB);
\`\`\`

This lets us easily parse the strings and convert them from string to hex to decimal (storing them in our \`ledStrip\`, \`tempR\`, \`tempG\`, and \`tempB\` variables) since we needed RGB values between 0 and 255.


## Thats pretty much it

When looking at the GitHub there really isn't that much code. But there's a long story to many of these functions, hours of writing on whiteboards, trying different synchronization methods, troubleshooting SSL, and more. 

Languages like C and C++ can be frustrating at times but also incredibly satisfying. It felt like I was writing firmware for a sellable product, integrating with a big server.

I can't lie I felt so cool telling David hours before the launch:
> "I'll be right back I gotta update the module's firmware"

When all I was doing was uploading code.

## Some Changes I'd Do

I mentioned earlier I want to try the mesh network code where the modules talk to each other, but there are other small things I'd change. 

* I'd have each module save a firmware number. I ran into issues where I wasn't sure if I had updated them all. There were 55 of them in the building, so it was easy to forget to update a module after some changes. If I added a firmware number like \`v10\` I could have each module upload it to the server and quickly find which one didn't have all of my new changes

* I'd also get remote uploads working. This wouldn't fix all our issues because we struggled with them retaining a WIFI connection, but a remote upload would allow them to be more easily updated.

Hopefully, if the project gets to run again I can add some of these changes along with some new *secret* features. If you've never done an electronics project before I heavily recommend trying something with Arduinos, it's a lot of fun.
