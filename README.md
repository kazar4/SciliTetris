On April 14, 2000 Brown's University's Science Librarie (Scili) was turned into the Worlds Largest Tetris display ever made at the time. Our goal 24 years later was toe recreate this project, but with better technology and more games. 

With only a semester to finish before graduating we developed a multi-threaded server and game engine backend capable of websocket connections, and
dozens of custom microcontroller PCBs to control our LEDs over wifi.
