On April 14th 2000, Brown's University's Science Library (SciLi) was turned into the Worlds Largest Tetris display ever made at the time. While incredibly impressive for its time, it was limited by the technology available. Featuring christmas lights with only one color option and a design not very reproducible. Our goal 24 years later was to recreate this project, but with more **colors**, more **games**, and a **reproducible system** that could be set up easily.

With only a semester to finish before graduating we developed a multi-threaded server and game engine backend capable of controlling hundreds of websocket connections, and dozens of custom microcontroller PCBs to control our LEDs over wifi.

_This project is dedicated to the Brown University Class of '24, and a testament to all the amazing things our class did over the past 4 years, even with our freshmen year being during COVID._
